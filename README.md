# Password-Manager
A Project on Cyber sercurity The Passwaord Manager
 🔐 Password Manager – Secure Offline Credential Vault

A secure, offline password manager application built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, **SQLite**, and **AES encryption**. This tool allows users to store, manage, and retrieve credentials with a strong focus on privacy and usability.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was created to solve a common security problem: password reuse and insecure storage. Unlike cloud-based managers, this application runs entirely offline, giving users **full control** over their encrypted data.

## 📌 Features

- 🔑 **Master Password Authentication** using SHA-256 hashed key
- 🔒 **AES-256 Encryption (CBC mode)** for all credentials
- 🧩 **CRUD Operations**: Add, View, Update, and Delete records
- 📋 **Clipboard Integration**: Securely copy passwords temporarily
- 🔍 **Search Functionality** by website or username
- 🎨 **Tkinter GUI** with color-coded buttons and intuitive layout

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
   cd password-manager

 ## Install dependencies:
    
    pip install pycryptodome
## Run the application:
     
      python main.py

## 🔐 Security Notes
Master password is never stored – it's required each session to decrypt data.

Passwords are stored encrypted using AES (CBC) with a randomly generated IV.

This application does not require internet access, reducing exposure to external threats.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
✅ Password strength analyzer & generator

✅ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

✅ AWS cloud backup and sync

✅ Browser extension for autofill

✅ Role-based access for enterprise
